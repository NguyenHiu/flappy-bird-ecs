## Flappy Bird ECS

hi guys, recently, i've learned about entity component system (ecs). So, this repo is just a mess i made after reading some concepts about ecs. While struggling to complete this project, i found there are some popular ecs frameworks with common approaches used in practice. Yes, i started this project with just some basic concepts about entity, component and system; and it got even worse after i just learned oop and some advanced (not much) techniques in oop, so i wanted to apply them into the game while using ecs (i know how stupid it is). 

However, i'm glad that i did this project, i feel like it's a milestone in my journey, even though it's a mess xDD
